### What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and svg images?

Different image types are useful for different purposes. JPG/JPEG is great for photos because it compresses well (and has a wide range of colors). GIF is best for simple animations and small graphics. PNG is sharp and supports transparency, so it’s great for icons, logos, and images with text. SVG is a vector format, which means it can scale to any size without losing quality (its defined numerically) and is perfect for logos and illustrations.
