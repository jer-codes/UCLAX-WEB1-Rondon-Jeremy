### What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a tool you run on your computer to track changes in your code, manage different versions, and work on multiple features at the same time. GitHub is a website that hosts your Git projects in the cloud. It lets you share your code with others, collaborate on changes, open issues, and handle pull requests. Basically, Git keeps track of your work locally, while GitHub helps teams work together online.
