### What is the difference between a Front-End and Back-End Developer?

A Front-End Developer works on the part of a website you actually see and interact with, like the layout, buttons, and design, usually using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A Back-End Developer works behind the scenes on servers, databases, and APIs to make sure everything works correctly. Basically, front-end is what you see, back-end is what makes it all run.
