### Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all make up web pages, with each doing something different. HTML is the skeleton of the page that sets up headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS is what makes it look nicer, controlling colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. JavaScript makes the page interactive, letting you click buttons, show animations, or pull in data from a server. Together, they make websites structured, pretty, and interactive.
