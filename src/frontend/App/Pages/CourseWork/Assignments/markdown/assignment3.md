### What is the difference between jQuery and React?

jQuery is an older JavaScript library that makes it easier to change the page, handle clicks, and load data without refreshing. React is more modern and focuses on building user interfaces with reusable components and a virtual DOM. While jQuery just manipulates the page directly, React makes it easier to manage complex apps and keeps everything organized, which is why most big projects use React these days.
