### In React, what are the different ways we can link to resources (e.g., Root Relative vs Document Relative)?

In React, we can link to files like images or styles via 1) a root-relative path, which starts from the root of the project and works no matter where the file is used, and 2) a document-relative path, which is relative to the file the user is working in and can break if the file moves.
